# Floating Point Multiplication using Pipeline

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Computer Architecture project on Floating Point Multiplication using pipeline. The circuit for this has been implemented in Logisim.

## Project Overview

A pipeline architecture for performing floating point multiplication allows for efficient and parallel execution of the multiplication operation, resulting in improved performance.

## Repository Structure

`Floating Point Multiplication.circ` is the circuit diagram for the project built using Logisim.

`Report.pdf` is a detailed explanation of the project with circuit diagrams and examples.
